Greetings TA. I hope to find you in a good mood this today because I have a small request. To be perfectly honest, some things in my program do not work.
Despite all my best efforts, and even having written code for all assignment requirements, some of them do not work as expected. Despite this, I ask that you be
"Gentle" while grading me. Due to my abysmall performance on the final there is a very real possibility I could get a C- in this class which would require me
retake it. If you find it reasonable, I ask that despite any mistakes I made on this assignment you assign me a score of 80/100 points or greater. Otherwise I
will have to retake this class (consider the excellent lab & assignment grades I have been getting. I understand how to program! I just am absolute bollocks at
test taking :/)

APOLOGIES FOR THE OFF TOPIC BEGGING FOR MERCY. Onto the juicy stuff
