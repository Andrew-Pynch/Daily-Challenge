# Daily Challenge

Completing daily challenges in this Repo to maintain and improve programming abilities



# To Do:
- Explore Object Oriented Programming: I have shied away from this style of programming due to this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM
Despite the valid points this video makes, I am beginning to understand that in order to be a well rounded software 
engineer, I need to have mastery of OOT and related concepts. 
  -Conretely: I need to find a project that will require use of OOT and related concepts and then complete that project ASAP
  
 -Implement a library of common machine learning algorithms and tools to develop proficiency at the lowest level of the conceptual hierarchy. As Feynman famously said "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
